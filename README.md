# next-boilerplate

A boilerplate for developing react and [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) based SPA projects

There're 4 branches, allow me to explain them:

1. The master branch: it integrates react, react-dom, next.js, [standard](https://github.com/standard/standard), [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) step by step.
2. The mui branch: adding [material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) upon master
3. The apollo branch: adding [apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) upon master, using github graphql api as backend
3. The apollo-mui branch: combining apollo and material-ui

The main popurse of this repo is being a demonstration of how a developer can create a boilerplate containing major pieces in several hours

Thanks to the great efforts made by [next.js example contributors](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples), it's a piece of cake to pick what you wish, combine them together to be your own boilerplate now
